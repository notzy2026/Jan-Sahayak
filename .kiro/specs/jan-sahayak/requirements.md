# Requirements Document: Jan-Sahayak (Voice-First Civil Caseworker)

## Introduction

Jan-Sahayak is a voice-first, vernacular AI agent designed to bridge the welfare scheme utilization gap across India. The system enables citizens to discover their eligibility for government welfare schemes across multiple sectors—including agriculture, disability support, women empowerment, health, and education scholarships—and generate filled application forms through natural voice conversations in local dialects, accessible via WhatsApp or toll-free numbers.

The core innovation is eliminating middlemen by automatically generating completed PDF application forms based on voice interactions, making welfare schemes accessible to citizens with literacy, language, and accessibility barriers across diverse socio-economic backgrounds.
